                        Stan Lee, born Stanley Martin Lieber (December 28, 1922 â€“ November 12, 2018), was an American
                        comic book writer, editor, publisher, and media personality. He rose to prominence during the
                        1960s at Marvel Comics, co-creating iconic superheroes that have become cultural touchstones.

                        <p class="hidden">Some of Stan Lee's most inspiring quotes:
                            "With great power comes great responsibility." (This iconic line from Spider-Man remains a
                            powerful message.)
                            "I used to swatch flies. I would try to figure out why in the world a superhero would fight
                            another superhero.
                            There had to be a good reason." (Lee emphasized the importance of well-developed
                            narratives.)</p>
